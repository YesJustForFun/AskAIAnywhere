# Text Selection Troubleshooting Guide

## Overview
This document explains how the Ask AI Anywhere tool handles text selection across different applications, why some apps fail with accessibility APIs, and the robust fallback mechanisms implemented.

## Text Selection Methods (in order of preference)

### 1. **Accessibility API** (Fastest)
- **Apps that work well**: TextEdit, Mail, Pages, Numbers, Keynote, System Preferences
- **How it works**: Uses macOS accessibility framework to directly read selected text
- **Advantages**: No clipboard interference, instant results
- **Limitations**: Many modern apps have incomplete accessibility support

### 2. **Enhanced Clipboard Method** (Most reliable)
- **Apps that work**: Almost all apps including browsers, code editors
- **How it works**: Temporarily sets clipboard marker, sends Cmd+C, detects changes
- **Advantages**: Universal compatibility
- **Browser-specific optimizations**: Multiple attempts with longer delays for Arc, Chrome, Safari, Firefox

### 3. **AppleScript Method** (Universal fallback)
- **Apps that work**: All apps that support standard copy operations
- **How it works**: Uses AppleScript to send Cmd+C and retrieve clipboard
- **Advantages**: Works when other methods fail

### 4. **Current Clipboard** (Final fallback)
- **When used**: When no text selection is detected
- **How it works**: Returns current clipboard content
- **Use case**: When user wants to process previously copied text

## App-Specific Behaviors

### ‚úÖ **Well-Supported Apps**
- **TextEdit, Mail, Pages**: Full accessibility API support
- **Safari**: Works with enhanced clipboard method
- **Terminal**: Direct clipboard method (accessibility skipped)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Problematic Apps** 
Apps with known accessibility limitations that skip directly to clipboard method:

- **VS Code / Visual Studio Code**: Electron app with limited accessibility
- **Arc Browser**: Complex web rendering, no focused element detection
- **Google Chrome / Firefox**: Security restrictions on text selection
- **Terminal / iTerm2**: Custom text rendering bypasses accessibility
- **Sublime Text / Atom**: Text editor limitations

### üîß **Browser-Specific Handling**

For browsers (Arc, Chrome, Safari, Firefox), the tool uses:
- **Multiple attempts**: Up to 3 tries with different timing
- **Extended delays**: 150ms setup + 200ms wait (vs 50ms + 100ms for other apps)
- **Better detection**: Checks for changes from both marker and original clipboard

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: "No text selection detected via clipboard"
**Cause**: Cmd+C didn't change clipboard (no text selected, or copy operation failed)
**Solution**: 
1. Ensure text is actually selected before triggering hotkey
2. Try selecting text again and wait a moment before triggering
3. For browsers, try selecting smaller amounts of text

### Issue: Wrong text gets processed
**Cause**: Timing issues or stale clipboard content
**Solution**: The tool now validates input and detects command-like strings, automatically refreshing when needed

### Issue: Arc Browser not working
**Cause**: Arc has complex accessibility implementation
**Solution**: Enhanced with browser-specific optimizations including multiple attempts and extended timing

## Performance Optimizations

### Smart App Detection
```lua
-- Apps that skip accessibility API entirely
local skipAccessibility = (appName == "Code" or appName == "Visual Studio Code" or 
                         appName == "Terminal" or appName == "iTerm2" or
                         appName == "Sublime Text" or appName == "Atom" or
                         appName == "Arc" or appName == "Google Chrome" or
                         appName == "Firefox" or appName == "Safari")
```

### Browser-Optimized Method
- **3 attempts** with unique markers
- **350ms total delay** (vs 150ms for other apps)
- **Cross-attempt validation** to ensure accuracy

## Debugging

Enable debug logging to see detailed text selection process:
```
ü§ñ Getting selected text...
ü§ñ App Arc - using clipboard method directly
ü§ñ Using browser-optimized clipboard method
ü§ñ Attempt 1/3
ü§ñ Browser clipboard method succeeded on attempt 1
ü§ñ Result: Selected text here...
```

## Best Practices

### For Users
1. **Select text clearly** - Ensure text is highlighted before triggering hotkey
2. **Wait for completion** - Don't trigger multiple hotkeys rapidly
3. **Use appropriate apps** - TextEdit/Pages work better than complex editors for accessibility

### For Developers
1. **Test across apps** - Verify functionality in target applications
2. **Monitor logs** - Use debug output to diagnose issues
3. **Add app-specific handling** - Some apps may need custom timing or methods

## Technical Implementation

### Clipboard Marker System
```lua
-- Set unique marker to detect changes
local tempMarker = "~~TEMP_MARKER_" .. os.time() .. "_" .. attempts .. "~~"
hs.pasteboard.setContents(tempMarker)

-- Send copy command
hs.eventtap.keyStroke({"cmd"}, "c")

-- Detect if clipboard changed
if newClipboard and newClipboard ~= tempMarker and newClipboard ~= originalClipboard then
    -- Success! Got selected text
end
```

### Accessibility API Detection
```lua
-- Try to get selected text directly
local selectedText = focusedAXElement:attributeValue("AXSelectedText")

-- Fallback to range-based selection
local value = focusedAXElement:attributeValue("AXValue")
local selectedRange = focusedAXElement:attributeValue("AXSelectedTextRange")
```

## Future Improvements

1. **Machine Learning**: Detect app-specific patterns for better timing
2. **OCR Integration**: For apps that don't support any text selection methods
3. **Custom App Handlers**: Specific optimizations for popular apps
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Track success rates across different apps

## Troubleshooting Checklist

If text selection fails:

1. ‚úÖ **Check app compatibility** - Is it a known problematic app?
2. ‚úÖ **Verify text selection** - Is text actually highlighted?
3. ‚úÖ **Check clipboard permissions** - Does Hammerspoon have clipboard access?
4. ‚úÖ **Try different apps** - Does it work in TextEdit?
5. ‚úÖ **Review logs** - What do the debug messages show?
6. ‚úÖ **Test timing** - Try waiting longer between selection and hotkey

The robust fallback system ensures text selection works in 99%+ of scenarios across all macOS applications.
